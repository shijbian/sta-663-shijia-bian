For example, LSA can be used to search for prior art given a new patent application. In this homework, we will implement a small library for simple latent semantic analysis as a practical example of the application of SVD. The ideas are very similar to PCA.\n",

      "1. Begin by loading a pubmed database of selected article titles using 'cPickle'. With the following:\n",

      "docs = cPickle.load(open('pubmed.pic'))```\n",
      "\n",
      "    Create a tf-idf matrix for every term that appears at least once in any of the documents. What is the shape of the tf-idf matrix? \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Perform SVD on the tf-idf matrix to obtain $U \\Sigma V^T$ (often written as $T \\Sigma D^T$ in this context with $T$ representing the terms and $D$ representing the documents). If we set all but the top $k$ singular values to 0, the reconstructed matrix is essentially $U_k \\Sigma_k V_k^T$, where $U_k$ is $m \\times k$, $\\Sigma_k$ is $k \\times k$ and $V_k^T$ is $k \\times n$. Terms in this reduced space are represented by $U_k \\Sigma_k$ and documents by $\\Sigma_k V^T_k$. Reconstruct the matrix using the first $k=10$ singular values.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Use agglomerative hierachical clustering with complete linkage to plot a dendrogram and comment on the likely number of  document clusters with $k = 100$. Use the dendrogram function from [SciPy ](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Determine how similar each of the original documents is to the new document `mystery.txt`. Since $A = U \\Sigma V^T$, we also have $V = A^T U S^{-1}$ using orthogonality and the rule for transposing matrix products. This suggests that in order to map the new document to the same concept space, first find the tf-idf vector $v$ for the new document - this must contain all (and only) the terms present in the existing tf-idx matrix. Then the query vector $q$ is given by $v^T U_k \\Sigma_k^{-1}$. Find the 10 documents most similar to the new document and the 10 most dissimilar. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Many documents often have some boilerplate material such as organization information, Copyright, etc. at the front or back of the document. Does it matter that the front and back matter of each document is essentially identical for either LSA-based clustering (part 3) or information retrieval (part 4)? Why or why not?"
